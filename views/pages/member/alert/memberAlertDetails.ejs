  {% set message="Mr. John Doe,

Thank you for your recent application to become a writer on Woculus.
We are very much complimented that you would like to write for Woculus.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry.Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s,when an unknown printer took a galley of
type and scrambled it to make a typespecimen book. It has survived
not only five centuries, but also the leap intoelectronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
Ipsum passages,and more recently with desktop publishing software
like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

I would appreciate being notified if you wish to cancel your
application for any reason.

Best regards," %}
